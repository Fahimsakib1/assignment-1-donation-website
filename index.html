            <h1> Foods For Families</h1>
            <p>Donating to a homeless charity is always a good idea. And considering that most of them are run by non-profit organizations, they really do need those donations. Food is one of the most basic human needs and is also usually the most needed item at a homeless charity. But while fresh foods might be healthier and may seem like the more logical choice, they don’t last that long.</p>

            <h1> Shelter For Families</h1>
            <p>Not everyone gets to have a roof over their head every night or a bedroom all to themselves. For those of us who understand how fortunate we are, hearing that others go without things that we consider essentials is disconcerting at best and heart-wrenching at worst. When you feel the call to help those less fortunate, it’s understandable that you would want to know you’re helping as much as you can.</p>

            <h1> Education For Children</h1>
            <p>MORE than 21 million Bangladeshis live in extreme poverty and they cannot pay for the education of their children. A lack of education-friendly environment, ignorance of the parents and financial constraints often cause dropouts from the school. Eventually, it creates a vicious circle in society — being poor, they cannot afford education and as they cannot afford education, they remain poor. </p>
